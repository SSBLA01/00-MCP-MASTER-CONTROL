# Dobbs-MCP Update: Full Dropbox File Control Added! ðŸŽ‰

I've just enhanced the Dobbs-MCP server with full file control capabilities. You now have:

## New Tools Available:
1. **copy_file** - Copy any file (including MP4 videos!)
2. **move_file** - Move files between folders
3. **delete_file** - Delete files or folders
4. **create_folder** - Create new directories

## How to Use:
1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the updated MCP server
2. You can now use natural language commands like:
   - "Copy all MP4 files from MathematicalResearch/manim_outputs to sandbox"
   - "Move the latest video to a new folder called 'presentations'"
   - "Create a folder called 'video_archive'"
   - "Delete old test files"

## Example: Copy Manim Videos to Sandbox
```
Copy file from MathematicalResearch/manim_outputs/media/videos/manim_ed84a813/720p30/LinearTransformation.mp4 to sandbox/LinearTransformation.mp4
```

## Total Tools Available: 31
- 8 Dropbox file operations (including the new ones!)
- 7 GitHub operations
- 4 Research discovery tools
- 4 Mathematical visualization tools
- 4 Knowledge management tools
- 4 Research coordination tools

The enhanced server is already in your GitHub repository at:

Enjoy your new file control powers! ðŸš€
