# MCP Security Backup - July 20, 2025

## System State Before Security Implementation

This document serves as a backup reference point before implementing security restrictions.

### Current MCP Configuration (WORKING STATE)
- **Total Tools**: 43+ fully functional
- **File Access**: Unrestricted Dropbox and local filesystem
- **API Keys**: Stored in .env file (functional but insecure)
- **Path Validation**: None (vulnerable but working)

### Functionality To Preserve
- All Dropbox operations in knowledge system folders
- GitHub repository management
- Obsidian note creation and reading
- Manim animation generation
- Gemini AI integration
- Research discovery tools

### Security Changes Being Implemented
1. **Local Filesystem Restrictions**: Limit access to specific directories
2. **Totem Networks Protection**: Block access to 01_Totem_Networks folder
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all file paths
4. **API Key Security**: Move to macOS Keychain

### Rollback Instructions
If security changes break functionality:
1. Restore file_operations.py from this commit
2. Restore .env file with API keys
3. Remove input validation temporarily
4. Test each tool individually

### Files Modified for Security
- src/servers/file_operations.py (path restrictions)
- src/servers/master_coordinator.py (validation)
- .env handling (key storage)

### Emergency Contacts
- Repository: SSBLA01/00-MCP-MASTER-CONTROL
- Branch: main (pre-security state)
- Commit SHA: To be recorded after security implementation

**Note**: This backup ensures we can restore full functionality if security measures interfere with essential MCP operations.
