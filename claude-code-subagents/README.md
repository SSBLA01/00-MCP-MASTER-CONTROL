## Manim Swarm System

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# Run swarm for specific concept
python scripts/run_manim_swarm.py --concept gyrovector

# Batch discovery
python scripts/run_manim_swarm.py --batch

# Full scan across all categories
python scripts/run_manim_swarm.py --full-scan
```

### Integration with MCP
```python
# Import manim swarm
from src.manim_swarm import ManimSwarm

# Deploy swarm
swarm = ManimSwarm()
patterns = await swarm.deploy_swarm("hyperbolic geometry")

# Enhance agents with discoveries
swarm.enhance_agents(patterns)
```

## NLP to Manim Pipeline

### New Module: `nlp_manim_pipeline.py`
Complete natural language processing pipeline for animation generation:
- **Parser**: Extracts objects, transformations, and parameters from descriptions
- **Code Generator**: Creates Manim code with appropriate templates
- **Validator**: Ensures mathematical accuracy and numerical stability

### Example Usage
```python
from src.nlp_manim_pipeline import process_animation_request

result = process_animation_request(
    "Create an animation showing a stereo projected S¬≥ sphere on a polar plane, then rotate the plane relative to the pole"
)

if result["success"]:
    print(result["manim_code"])  # Ready-to-run Manim code
```

## Installation

1. **Create directories**:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
```

2. **Copy sub-agents**:
```bash
cp *.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

3. **Install NLP dependencies**:
```bash
pip install spacy sympy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

4. **Verify installation**:
Use `/agents` command in Claude Code to see all available sub-agents.
