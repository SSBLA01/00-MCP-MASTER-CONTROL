- **6 Notion operations** âœ¨

## Important Notes

1. **Permissions**: You must share pages/databases with your integration
2. **Parent Pages**: When creating pages, you need a parent page ID (use search to find)
3. **Rate Limits**: Notion API has rate limits - avoid rapid bulk operations
4. **Content Types**: Currently supports text/markdown (images via URLs only)

## Troubleshooting

- **"Parent page ID required"**: Use search_notion to find a page to create under
- **"Unauthorized"**: Make sure page is shared with your integration
- **"Not found"**: Check that the page/database ID is correct

Happy Notion integration! ðŸš€
