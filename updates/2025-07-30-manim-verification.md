# Update: Natural Language Manim Interface Verified ✅

## Verification Complete (2025-07-30)

The Natural Language Manim Interface has been thoroughly tested and verified. The system successfully:

1. **Parses natural language** → Manim code
2. **Prevents text overlapping** with TextLayoutManager
3. **Creates partial renders** → uncached_XXXXX.mp4 files
4. **Combines with FFMPEG** → Final MP4 output
5. **Delivers to custom paths** → Media/Manim/

### Test Results
- Created `NL_Test_Verification.mp4` (148KB)
- 7 partial animations combined successfully
- Final MP4 properly saved to Media/Manim/

### Confirmed Rendering Process
```
Manim → Partial MP4s → FFMPEG concat → Final MP4
```

The system is fully operational and ready for production use!
