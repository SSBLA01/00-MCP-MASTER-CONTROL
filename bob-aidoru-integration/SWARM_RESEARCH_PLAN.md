# Bob Aidoru: Swarm Research Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines how we'll coordinate our MCP tools and AI agents to work together as a research team for the Bob Aidoru integration.

## AI Agent Roles

### Gemini (Code Supervisor)
- Conducts code reviews on all pull requests
- Ensures architectural consistency
- Provides technical guidance
- Monitors code quality metrics

### Kimi K2 (Creative Coding & Visualization)
- Creates Manim visualizations for system architecture
- Develops data flow animations
- Designs UI animations
- Produces test result visualizations

### Claude (Project Coordinator)
- Manages project tasks
- Creates documentation
- Maintains Obsidian knowledge base
- Tracks progress
- Facilitates team communication

## Development Tracks (8-12 Weeks)

| Track | Description | Timeline | Lead Agent |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Track 1: FastAPI Backend** | Core API development | 4-6 weeks | Gemini |
| **Track 2: Character Engine** | Personality implementation | 4-6 weeks | Claude + Gemini |
| **Track 3: MCP Tool Adapters** | Tool integration | 6-8 weeks | Gemini |
| **Track 4: Dashboard Integration** | Visual interface | 4-6 weeks | Kimi K2 |
| **Track 5: Testing Infrastructure** | CI/CD pipeline | 2-4 weeks | Gemini |

## GitHub Branch Strategy

```
main (protected)
  └── develop
       ├── feature/fastapi-backend
       ├── feature/character-engine
       ├── feature/tool-adapters
       ├── feature/dashboard-integration
       └── feature/testing-infrastructure
```

### Branch Protection Rules
- Main branch: Requires code review + successful CI/CD
- Develop branch: Requires at least one code review
- Feature branches: No direct commits, only through PRs

## Visualization Deliverables (Kimi K2)

1. **System Architecture Diagram** (Week 1)
   - High-level component overview
   - Data flow visualization

2. **Progress Dashboard** (Week 2)
   - Real-time development metrics
   - Integration status tracking

3. **Test Coverage Visualization** (Week 4)
   - Code coverage maps
   - Test success rate charts

4. **Performance Metrics** (Week 6)
   - Response time analysis
   - Resource usage graphs

## Proof of Concept Milestones

### Week 2: Basic Communication
- Voice command → Dashboard update
- Validates pipeline architecture

### Week 4: Character Demo
- Bob responds with personality
- Basic conversational flow

### Week 6: Tool Integration
- 5 priority tools connected
- End-to-end functionality

### Week 8: Integration Test
- All components working together
- Performance benchmarks met

### Week 10-12: Polish & Scale
- Additional tool integration
- Performance optimization
- User experience refinement

## Coordination Workflow

1. **Daily Sync** (Claude)
   - Update Obsidian project notes
   - Track blockers and progress

2. **Code Review** (Gemini)
   - All PRs reviewed within 24 hours
   - Architecture consistency checks

3. **Weekly Demo** (Kimi K2)
   - Visual progress presentation
   - New animations/visualizations

4. **Sprint Planning** (All)
   - Bi-weekly planning sessions
   - Priority adjustment

## Success Criteria

- ✅ No disruption to existing MCP tools
- ✅ All tests passing in CI/CD
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ User feedback positive

## Risk Management

- **Isolated Development**: Feature branches prevent main disruption
- **Incremental Integration**: Small, tested changes
- **Rollback Plan**: Each component can be reverted
- **Monitoring**: Continuous health checks
