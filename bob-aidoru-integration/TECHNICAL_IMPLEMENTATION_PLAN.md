# Bob Aidoru Integration: Technical Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical implementation plan for integrating Bob, an AI-powered research assistant (aidoru), with our MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools ecosystem. The project transforms voice commands from a mobile device into sophisticated tool operations across our 43 Dobbs-MCP mathematical research tools.

## Core Components

### 1. FastAPI Backend
- Manages session state and conversation context
- Integrates with character engine for personality
- Translates natural language to MCP tool calls
- Handles error scenarios gracefully

### 2. Character Engine
- **Obsidian Connector**: Builds knowledge graph from notes
- **Pattern Analyzer**: Tracks research behaviors
- **Dynamic Prompt Constructor**: Generates contextual responses

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- Real-time visual feedback of Bob's actions
- Command history and status display
- Bidirectional state synchronization

### 4. MCP Tool Adapters
- Standardized interface for each tool
- Intent-to-API translation layer
- Error handling and fallback logic

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Rapid Prototype (Week 1-2)
- Establish communication pipeline
- Mock implementations for testing
- Basic dashboard status updates

### Phase 2: Character Integration (Week 3-4)
- Implement basic character engine
- Static personality prompts
- Simple Obsidian keyword search

### Phase 3: Tool Execution (Week 5-6)
- Connect to 5-10 priority MCP tools
- Implement command mapping logic
- Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 4: Intelligence Enhancement (Week 7-12)
- Advanced Obsidian graph traversal
- Complex pattern recognition
- Conversation history integration

## Priority MCP Tools for Integration

1. Manim animation generation
2. Obsidian note search/retrieval
3. Gemini AI consultations
4. File search and management
5. Mathematical computation tools

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Component-level validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows
- **User Experience Tests**: Natural interaction validation
- **Performance Tests**: Response latency < 2 seconds

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication for mobile app
- Encrypted communication channels
- User isolation and rate limiting
- Audit logging for all commands

## Success Metrics

- 95% voice command recognition accuracy
- Zero downtime for existing MCP tools
- Positive user feedback on interactions
- Successful integration of 10+ tools

## Risk Mitigation

- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive rollback procedures
- Isolated development environment
- Continuous monitoring and alerts
