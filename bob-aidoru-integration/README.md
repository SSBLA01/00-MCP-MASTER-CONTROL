# Bob Aidoru Integration Planning

This directory contains the planning and implementation documentation for integrating Bob, an AI-powered voice assistant with a trickster personality, into the Dobbs-MCP tools ecosystem.

## ⚠️ Development Status

**PLANNING PHASE** - No active development yet. This documentation is for planning purposes.

## Overview

Bob transforms voice commands from a mobile device into sophisticated tool operations across our 43 Dobbs-MCP mathematical research tools, while maintaining his unique personality as a trickster archetype who guides users toward deeper insights.

## Key Documents

- `TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed technical architecture
- `SWARM_RESEARCH_PLAN.md` - Coordinated implementation approach
- `BRANCH_STRATEGY.md` - GitHub branching and CI/CD strategy

## Development Timeline

8-12 weeks for full implementation across 5 parallel tracks:

1. FastAPI Backend (4-6 weeks)
2. Character Engine (4-6 weeks)  
3. MCP Tool Adapters (6-8 weeks)
4. Dashboard Integration (4-6 weeks)
5. Testing Infrastructure (2-4 weeks)

## Safety Measures

- Development will occur in isolated feature branches
- No changes to main branch until thoroughly tested
- CI/CD pipeline will prevent breaking changes
- Rollback procedures documented for each component

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve implementation plans
2. Create feature branch structure
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Begin development in isolated environment
